Don't summarize the steps that you've taken when you've accomplished a goal. Just say "Done!".

Check if there is a running dev server at port 5173 before opening another one.

Avoid navigating between directories. Run commands from the root of the repo and rely on nx to run the right things.

Whenever the website has been changed, after you are done with the rest of your work confirm that it is working using playwright and `npm run dev`. 

When interacting with the terminal, remember that you are using @PowerShell.

Avoid `any` types. You can usually identify a more specific type that will work.

New source files should be `.ts` or `.svelte`, not `.js`.

Rather than using comments to annotate a type, add a `lang='ts'` statement or change the extension to `.ts`.
