blurb: Postman is great, but we could do better.
---

I use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) a lot at work. It's really helpful to have an interface where I can write down a request, run it, and then iterate on it based on the response. However, the fact that it's a GUI tool puts some real limitations on it. 

Between VS Code, zoom, docker, firefox, and slack, I'm often already pushing my computer a little harder than it's happy place, and adding another electron application isn't ideal. Worse than that, trying to eyeball my way through a 500 line JSON response is no fun at all. 

I'd much rather have a CLI tool where I can pipe the results into [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and explore to my hearts content in a more focused way. For a while I tried just using `curl`, but that had a different set of problems. Editing requests in Postman feels like iterating on code. I have a static document representing the request that can be saved between sessions, pull secrets from the environment (sort of), and have meaningful structure related to what I'm building. Iterating on a curl request just feels bad, especially when I need to send a request with a body.

I spent a while complaining to my coworkers that curl wouldn't run HTTP requests from a file, and after I got all the whinging out of my system I realized that this should be a relatively easy thing to build. I wanted something that could
- run as a CLI application
- read requests in a standard format from a static file
- be distributed as a static binary (none of this [install from npm](https://httpyac.github.io/) nonsense)

So I wrote [req](https://github.com/schicks/req/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Req takes in a file containing a [spec compliant](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html) HTTP request, performs that request, and returns the response body to stdout. By default it _only_ returns the body, making it simple to pipe into other tools, but on a flag it can return other metadata as well.

I get that the world probably didn't need another HTTP client, but it was fun to have a project to work in a language that I don't get to work in every day that filled a real gap in the way I work. Often I struggle to stick with projects because the goal feels kind of abstract. It was very nice to have something that I am already using regularly to test and debug HTTP apps.
