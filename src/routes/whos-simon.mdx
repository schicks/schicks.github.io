title: Who's Simon?
---

Simon is my older brother. I've never met him, but from what my parents have told me he was brave and outspoken, though also somewhat reckless. If I got close to a river they would say, "Stay away from the water or the crocodiles will get you. That's what happened to Simon." If I was being loud at the grocery store they would say, "If you don't calm down we're going to leave you here to fend for yourself. That's what happened to Simon."

Needless to say, I have always looked up to Simon, and often when I'm not sure what to do I ask myself; what would Simon say?
