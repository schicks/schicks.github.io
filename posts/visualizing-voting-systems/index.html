  <p>The US presidential election in 2000 was very strange. It was expected to be a tight race between George W Bush and Al Gore, but Ralph Nader was running as a third party candidate. Leading up to the election, a group of self identified “Naders Raiders” wrote an open letter to Nader asking him to drop out. They were worried that he would be handing the election to Bush.</p>
<blockquote class="svelte-lupz3r"><p>It is now clear that you might well give the White House to Bush. As a result, you would set back significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your entire, astonishing career. You have sacrificed for the benefit of the common good your entire adult life… It would be a cruel irony indeed if your major legacy were to erase the victory from the candidate who most embodies your philosophy, Al Gore, and to give the Executive Branch to the party which has consistently resisted your progressive ideals.
<sup id="fnref-raiders"><a href="#fn-raiders" class="footnote-ref">raiders</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Carl Pope, the president of the Sierra Club, pleaded with Nader to reconsider his campaign strategy.</p>
<blockquote class="svelte-lupz3r"><p>You pledged you would not campaign as a spoiler and would avoid the swing states. Your recent campaign rhetoric and campaign schedule make it clear that you have broken this pledge… Irresponsible as I find your strategy, I accept that you genuinely believe in it. Please accept that I, and the overwhelming majority of the environmental movement in this country, genuinely believe that your strategy is flawed, dangerous, and reckless.
<sup id="fnref-pope"><a href="#fn-pope" class="footnote-ref">pope</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The Republican leadership council ran campaign ads featuring Nader, believing that the more people that voted for Nader, the better chance Bush had at winning the election.</p>
<blockquote class="svelte-lupz3r"><p>Nader, running a low-budget campaign, is not airing any television commercials of his own and it’s possible that the RLC will end up spending more on pro-Nader media that Nader himself.
<sup id="fnref-gop"><a href="#fn-gop" class="footnote-ref">gop</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Why were environmentalists, relatively ideolically similar to Nader, pleading with him not to run? Why were republicans trying to get people to vote for one of their opponents? All of these people believed that votes for Nader would have the effect of electing Bush, because of something known as the <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/the-spoiler-effect/" rel="nofollow">spoiler effect</a>.</p>
<figure class="svelte-cane51"><svg id="yee-diagram-11" viewBox="0 0 100 100" class="svelte-cane51"><line x1="0" y1="50" x2="100" y2="50" stroke-color="black" class="svelte-cane51"></line></svg>
  <figcaption class="svelte-cane51">You can drag the candidates around to see how the result would change.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This visualization is called a <a href="https://electowiki.org/wiki/Yee_diagram" rel="nofollow">Yee diagram</a>. The colored circles represent the positions of the candidates in some abstract space. Imagine that the Y axis measures how focused the candidate is on environmental protection, and the X axis measures their position on some other issue like corporate tax rates. The background is colored based on who would win if the average voter was at that point. If there is a tie, the background will be grey; the black line just gives us a sense of where the middle is.</p>
<p>The diagram is generated by simulating an election for each cell of the background, where the voters are randomly distributed around that cell. I would expect an ideal voting method to elect the candidate closest to any given cell, but because of the randomness in the simulation, the boundaries might change a little if you refresh the page. </p>
<p>These diagrams don’t tell us very much about any individual election, but they can help us explore how elections are shaped by the voting method that we choose. In the 2000 election, all ballots were counted using a method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting" rel="nofollow">plurality voting</a>, where each voter picks their favorite candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins, even if most people didn’t vote for them.</p>
<p>If only Bush and Gore had been running, the race would have been simple, the winner would be whoever was closer to the center of public opinion. But strange things start to happen when we consider Nader.</p>
<div style="min-height: 600px;"></div>
<p>Because Nader is ideologically closer to Gore, voters are more likely to switch to Nader from Gore than to Nader from Bush. Depending on where we believe the average voter is this might not matter, but if we think that public opinion is somewhere between Bush and Gore, this is very likely to help Bush win. This is the spoiler effect that environmentalists were afraid of, and why republicans wanted to amplify Naders message.</p>
<p>The lesson many people take from the spoiler effect is that third party candidates harm the platforms they care about, but the spoiler effect doesn’t happen in every voting system. While there are versions of this effect in plurality voting and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting" rel="nofollow">ranked choice voting</a>, other systems like <a href="https://electionscience.org/approval-voting-101/" rel="nofollow">approval voting</a> don’t have this issue.</p>
<p>Approval voting ballots look very similar to plurality voting ballots, but voting involves selecting as many of the candidates as you would like rather than only your favorite. If plurality voting is asking voters who their favorite candidate is, approval voting is asking who voters would accept as the winner. </p>
<p>This means that there is another parameter we have to think about in the context of approval voting; how accepting are you? The less accepting you are, the more likely you are to only vote for one candidate, or to refuse to vote at all. The more accepting you are, the more likely you are to be ok with every candidate, and therefore indifferent to the outcome. The diagram below shows the dynamics of the same set of candidates, but in an election run with approval voting.</p>
<div style="min-height: 600px;"></div>
<label class="svelte-lupz3r">Change the acceptance radius to see how it impacts the results.
  <input type="range" min="1" max="80"></label>
<p>Regardless of the acceptance radius, approval voting has an important property; If a candidate doesn’t win the race, they don’t affect the results. You can see this in the above diagram; moving candidate A around can change a cell from B to A, but it never changes any cell from B to C.</p>
<p>In the 2000 election, this property would have meant that republicans wouldn’t have had any reason to encourage people to vote for one of their opponents. Environmentalists might have welcomed another candidate fighting for environmental justice, because voters who cared about the environment wouldn’t have to choose between Gore and Nader. Approval voting would give them a way to express that they were ok with either one.</p>
<p>For a long time the US has treated plurality voting as the only option, but that is changing. Voters in Maine used ranked choice voting to vote for president in the 2020 election, and the NYC mayoral election is happening right now with ranked choice. Voters in Fargo and St. Louis restructured their elections to use approval voting, and voters in <a href="https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/outside-the-box-voting-reform-in-the-bay-area/" rel="nofollow">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/breaking-the-partisan-mold-in-austin-texas/" rel="nofollow">Austin</a>, <a href="https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/bridging-the-political-divide-in-seattle/" rel="nofollow">Seattle</a>, <a href="https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/keeping-up-momentum-in-missouri/" rel="nofollow">Missouri</a>, and <a href="https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/bringing-freedom-of-choice-to-utah/" rel="nofollow">Utah</a> are working to change how they vote as well. You might soon have an opportunity to choose how your government is elected. What do you want your voting system to encourage?</p>
