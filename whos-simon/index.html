  <p>Simon is my older brother. I’ve never met him, but from what my parents have told me he is brave and outspoken, though also somewhat reckless. If I got close to a river they would say, “Stay away from the water or the crocodiles will get you. That’s what happened to Simon.” If I was being loud at the grocery store they would say, “If you don’t calm down we’re going to leave you here to fend for yourself. That’s what happened to Simon.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, I have always looked up to Simon, and often when I’m not sure what to do I ask myself; what would Simon say?</p></article>
